Our goal is to support childrenâ€™s desire to be life-long learners. Each childâ€™s overall development will be monitored and recorded in an appropriate manner.\r\n\r\nour classes\r\n\r\nChildren are placed in classes according to their ages. Playground for 2 to 3 year-olds; Nursery for 3 to 4 year-olds and Reception for 4 to 5 year-olds. Teacher to child ratios vary according to the age group. In Playgroup, there is one teacher for every four children. Our little ones in Nursery have one teacher for six eight children. The oldest group in the school, which is reception, is 8-10 children for one teacher. At Dolphins, we greatly appreciate these ratios as children receive maximum attention from their teachers when the classes are small and therefore well managed.\r\n\r\nOur curriculum is guided by the Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) Statutory Framework. This creative curriculum allows for children to receive a rich and varied experience that goes far beyond the minimal entitlement as identified in the current National Learning Framework for Early Childhood Development (ECD â€“ Uganda, Ministry of Education). At its heart, the EYFS recognizes that every child is unique and is constantly learning. Hence planning begins with an understanding of key developmental skills to be achieved and the content is selected to support these. These key skills for learning enable children to become good communicators, solve problems, work well with others and ultimately improve their own learning performance.\r\nThe seven areas of learning and development that our programmes follow are;\r\n\r\n    Personal, social and emotional development.\r\n    Physical development.\r\n    Communication and language.\r\n    Literacy\r\n    Mathematics\r\n    Understanding the world and\r\n    Expressive arts and design.\r\n\r\nOn-going observational assessments are completed on each child. These enable staff to identify each childâ€™s developmental abilities, interests and needs. It is through this information that the staff implements planning a for every childâ€™s continuing development through both structured and unstructured play-based activities. The key learning areas are reflected in our daily programme through a variety of materials and resources in our play areas. The early learning goals defined in the key learning areas help in laying secure foundations for every childâ€™s learning.\r\n', 'dol_6762806521.jpg', 0, 298, 0),

Now it has one. Lakeside Adventure Park is unique in Uganda and opened its beachside camp in Kyaggwe in September, 2011 with a whole host of activities to keep even the most high-energy visitors occupied.\r\n\r\nIt is possible to drive to Lakeside but that takes just under an hour and the boat ride is much more enjoyable. The park has two boats, one of which can shuttle up to 25 people across from the KK Beach Resort in Gabba in about 45 minutes and another, smaller boat which can seat eight and makes the crossing in about 10 minutes. If you arrive by small boat drivers meet you to take you the 5 minute drive to the park. All the boats are equipped with life preservers.\r\n\r\nThe ropes course is the real draw and why many people have heard of the park. It consists of two courses â€“ the low and high course â€“ and each take between 20-40 minutes to complete depending on the person. The courses are for both the young, and young at heart some as young as four and as old as 73 having completed the courses. Groups of 10 people can be climbing the course at any given time.\r\n\r\nThe courses involve climbing, clambering, balancing and swinging on and over swaying wooden stumps, ropes, and bridges from a height varying between 3m and 9m in height.  Thereâ€™s some physical acumen necessary but surprisingly little. As long as youâ€™re not afraid of heights you can probably finish and if you are afraid of heights this is a great, and safe, way of confronting that head on.\r\n\r\nNo climbing experience is necessary and safety neednâ€™t be a concern as the course was built by professionals using the highest quality mountaineering gear. Each climber is given a helmet and safety training on how to clip into the safety lines everyone is safe throughout the course. Those who fall, or simply canâ€™t go on, are lowered by their harnesses safely to the ground.\r\n\r\nIf youâ€™re not interested in climbing there are comfy couches, and chairs from which you watch the action while enjoying a drink from the â€˜La Fiestaâ€™ bar. Or, you can take a stroll down the grassy lawns (where those who canâ€™t sit still can play some Frisbee or football) past the bouncy castles to the beach and sit by the lake. There youâ€™ll also find a sand volleyball court, a dock from which you can fish, and a campfire.\r\n\r\nThe instructors and staff are friendly, fun-loving and conscientious â€“ watching carefully as each person makes their way around the ropes course and shouting up helpful tips when necessary.\r\n\r\nThe experience is fun and safe â€“ start to finish. And there is more to come with paintball, a climbing wall, climbing lessons and a night course all being planned. If youâ€™re interested in having a group stay overnight there is a dormitory and 4 bandas but you should make sure to call ahead for a reservation.\r\n\r\nLakeside Adventure Park is ideal for a fun afternoon with just about any group â€“ some friends, the family, school outings, birthday parties, youth groups or team building events. They do group catering and one teacher commented that heâ€™d never seen finicky teenagers so happy about the food served before.\r\n\r\nRemember to bring sunscreen, any sports equipment youâ€™re interested in playing, and wear sports clothes â€“ including trainers. If youâ€™re not ordering ahead for their group catering you should bring snacks/lunch and a few thousand UGX for drinks from the bar.\r\n\r\nThe ropes course costs 50,000 UGX per person with transportation and food being extra and dependent on the group.

But brightly colored lights, tables, and a hip cafe atmosphere have quickly set it apart from many of the cafes in the Kisimenti area. Hop on most boda boda motorcycles, tell them Iguana (a Kisimenti landmark nightspot), and theyâ€™ll know exactly where youâ€™re going, as Gusto is located directly underneath Iguana.\r\n\r\nYou can eat inside or outside. Their small, stone patio is set with 4-6 tables, most with umbrellas to provide you with some shade during hot days. Inside, which is still fairly open air, as there is only a half wall at the front, you can choose between eating at a regular table with normal chairs, or on a small colorful box, while reclining in what can only be described as â€œcar-styleâ€ seats. They are small, gray-backed cushioned chairs that are perfect for seating an informal group or working on your laptop.\r\n\r\nThis is, perhaps, what draws in the Gusto staple. If you head there during lunchtime, youâ€™ll see plenty of people enjoying food with friends. However, a huge number of patrons are on their laptops, working through the afternoon. The Internet is fairly reliable, although it does tend to drag if everyone in the cafe is using it.\r\n\r\nAt least you can always take a break and sample some of the food. This includes burgers, pizzas, a wide range of salads, and tapas. All of the food is reasonably priced with very few items breaching 20,000 UGX and only one or two heading towards 30,000 UGX. The pizzas are excellent, and itâ€™s quite easy to add toppings or take away from it for the perfect slice. However, the salads are what really got the buzz about Gusto going. Options like a smoked salmon salad (15,000 UGX) or a Carpaccio pesto (same price) are fresh, delicious, and such a nice break when youâ€™re used to getting â€˜chipsâ€™ with every single meal.\r\n\r\nThe tapas are also consistently well made. BBQ beef skewers, papas bravas, Spanish chicken strips, and beef strips are fantastic to snack on together when youâ€™re in a large group. Most of the tapas range from 6,000â€“12,000 UGX\r\nThe service at Gusto is also quite nice. The staff is quick, friendly, and often takes the time to get to know their regulars. Iâ€™m not at all embarrassed to say that when I come in, they often start making a cappuccino and bring me a soda water right away (later the chicken and fruit salad). This is what happens when you work from home and Gusto is nearby. You end up spending all your money there.\r\n\r\nOn weekends or evenings, itâ€™s normal to see large crowds come in, ramping up for the evening. They eat at Gusto, start their pre-funking there (with cocktails like the Caipirinha and Long Island iced tea why wouldnâ€™t you?) before heading up to Iguana to dance the night away. On Friday night Gusto plays to this crowd by offering the Sundowner BBQ. A few chairs outside are taken indoors and they set up a proper grill with loads of options. Shrimp, chicken, pork, and beef are all available on skewers. There is also a salad option that you can buy into and a DJ to top off the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nGusto is a great cafe offering good coffee, fresh salads, and all the olives you can get your hands on. It excels in bringing a bright, unique option to an area that already has so much; itâ€™s sort of hard to believe we needed another place to eat there. And yet, we very much did. Gusto also offers Brood Bread, take away, and will make reservations for large group upon request', 'gusto_9029944767.jpg', 0, 77, 0),

Italian coffee is known around the world as the greatest drink and people dream of traveling to Italy, just for the taste of the excellent coffee beverages. We established cafesserie , with the aim of bringing real Italian espresso to Africa. In Italy, espresso bars are the customary meeting place for coffee lovers, local business people and nearby residents. At Cafesserie , just as in Italy, the quality and the fine taste of the coffee as well the way it is prepared and served is always crucial to our concept.\r\nTo satisfy our passion for the best possible coffee , we decided to follow the coffee bean from its source; that is from the plantation and through our unique blending and the roasting process. we keep an â€œin houseâ€ coffee roasting machine concept to ensure that the coffee is at the peak of its freshness, flavor and aroma until the final preparation of a cup of classic Italian coffee.\r\nFrench bakery\r\nWe had a very clear vision and goal when we established the cafesserie Bakery and that is without a fraction of doubt to bring you the very best there is. To do that, we mastered the art of baking from the top bakers of the world.\r\n\r\n French â€œpatisserie-boulangerieâ€ which exactly replicates the way the classic French breads and pastries we all adore, are baked.We offer  our customers only the very best from around the world. We ensure that our selection of breads:- Whole-wheat, Grains, cheese rolls, olive bread, country bread, French bread, Sun-dried tomatoes bread, Foccacia and Ciabatta. as well as all our bakery items:- butter croissants, almond or chocolate croissants and brownies meets the highest standard of the French baking.\r\nContinental cuisine\r\n- we are proud of our â€œgourmet menuâ€ in which we only use quality fresh ingredients.

It has about two and a half times the number of people, several language scripts and numerous religions. So it is not easy to label its cuisine with a single heading. One has to allow for differences in climate, availability of produce, vast differences in incomes, religions, customs, traditions and beliefs.\r\n\r\nThe strongest influence on Indian cuisine, at least among 75 to 80 percent of Indians, is Ayurveda, an ancient body of knowledge on health. Ayur is derived from the word ayus meaning span of life in Sanskrit, and veda meaning knowledge. Thus, Ayurveda is knowledge regarding the maintenance of long life. It discusses the purpose of life, the importance of mental as well as physical health, and a code of ethical conduct for healthy living. The aim is salvation- to keep the body healthy and to give life such quality that one can progress beyond it. Life is a combination of mind, body and soul, and this is in fact the central subject of Ayurveda.\r\n\r\nAccording to Ayurveda, the human body is composed of seven body elements or tissue layers. These are plasma, blood, muscle, fat, bone, nerves, marrow and reproductive secretions. And there are innumerable channels that supply the various tissue constituents. Good health means proper flow through these channels and an equilibrium in the proportions of the seven body elements. Also, there are three primary life forces in the body, or three biological humors. The humors correspond primarily to the elements of air, fire and water. Ayurveda believes that when the humors are out of balance and aggravated, they manifest symptoms and give rise to various illnesses. The excess humors move into the bodyâ€™s channels, causing improprieties in their flow.\r\n\r\nIllnesses should first be treated with food and with medications only if required. The treatments using foods are based on six tastes (rasa in Sanskrit); sweet sour, salty, pungent, bitter and astringent. Each taste has its specific therapeutic actions. The tastes variously increase or decrease the biological humors. Everyone needs a certain amount of each of the six tastes, and relative proportions differ according to the constitutional or humor type of the particular individual. Too much of any one taste is harmful to any constitutional type. A lack of any of the six tastes in the food will also aggravate the relevant humor. Now one can appreciate the complexity of an Indian meal, which includes a spicy-sour taste mix, a yogurt-based item, a dash of a hot and bitter pickle, and a sweet. Vegetables play a more dominant role in Indian cuisine than perhaps any other. Usually one green and one other vegetable form part of every meal. India offers an array of vegetables unequaled anywhere in the world, and a variety of ways to prepare each one. Protein is also present in the Indian diet, but much effort is made to use protein derived from lentils and dairy products, rather than from meat. Legumes (lentils) or dhal, boiled with herbs and tomatoes, seasoned with spices and eaten with rice, provide the amino-acid balance that constitutes â€œcomplete proteinâ€. Indian cuisine is specially designed and committed to provide you a balanced, healthy diet. Ayurvedic teachings exhort people to follow a pure life-style, one that gives clarity and peace of mind.\r\n\r\nPhysical purity involves a wholesome diet with emphasis on raw or freshly cooked vegetarian food, pure air and water, proper exercise of a calming nature (yoga), and physical cleanliness. Purity of mind involves nonviolence, friendliness and compassion, and service to humanity. May our Pure Vegetarian Indian Cuisine help you maintain a long, healthy life. Thank you for choosing our restaurant for your unique dining experience. We are proud to bring you Pure Vegetarian Indian Cuisine the way it is meant to be...light, ', 'mango_7953081568.jpg', 0, 359, 0),

Itâ€™s in very few restaurants that you get to even have a glimpse of the boss.\r\n\r\nAt Pardis Mrs. Narges Salmani (proprietor and manager) takes it upon herself to welcome every visitor that enters the place. Talk of a wow factor, and there, you have it.\r\n\r\nThe restaurant itself is nothing fancy but at the same time itâ€™s so simple, exquisite, and more of an open restaurant with lots of natural light and breeze to ensure a fine dining experience as Middle Eastern songs play in the background.\r\n\r\nâ€œI got the design concept from the garden of the house. The design is purely respecting the existing trees in the garden. The stone, timber, arches and the colours used are to give an abstract feel of Middle Eastern designâ€ explains Pegah Salmani the architect who designed the restaurant on the concept and inspiration behind the simple design.\r\nTrue to their word, their menu offers a wide range of Middle Eastern cuisines to choose from. Its worthy to note that they arenâ€™t very big on vegetarian dishes but that shouldnâ€™t deter vegetarians as most of the starter courses are mainly vegetarian. For instance, Mixed Mezza (19,500 UGX), Hummus, Falafel sandwich (7,500 UGX), Vegetable Couscous (14,000 UGX), Moutabal (11,000 UGX) all served with hot pita bread. Not to mention the generous portions served would be doing Pardis a disservice.\r\n\r\nAs one would expect, grilled meat is a special on any Middle Eastern cuisine but for a group of two people on a budget Mrs. Narges recommends the mixed grill dish which is more than enough for two people. It includes 4 pieces of chicken kebab, minced lamb, pita bread, chips, 4 pieces of pizza and the whole dish is 27,000 UGX which is reasonably affordable compared to other restaurants around Upper Kololo.\r\n\r\nA full course at Pardis would cost you around 35,000 UGX onwards, and a single meal about 20,000UGX. A special discount is given to groups of five or more. Their Persian tea (6,000 UGX, per pot) is also very popular as it goes well with their renowned shisha (15,000 UGX) in the shisha garden. Expect no alcohol on the menu because of the Middle Eastern Muslim values, although you could carry your own bottle of wine and part with a corkage fee of 10,000 UGX.\r\n\r\nPardis being an open restaurant with very minimal dÃ©cor enhances the dining experience and diners arenâ€™t distracted. Thus perfect for lunch meetings, quiet diners and the clientele is a mix of foreigners and locals. Itâ€™s also suitable for birthday parties, small functions and accommodates crowds of less than 100.\r\n\r\nHowever, accessibility by foot might be tricky being that the restaurant is in upper Kololo. Fortunately, boda bodas are always nearby for those with no vehicles.\r\n\r\nOn future plans, band nights with some belly dancers are in the pipeline as itâ€™s a part of the Middle Eastern culture.\r\n\r\nPardis is open Monday to Sunday with the exception of Tuesday from 11:30 AM to midnight. The restaurant closes at 10:30 PM although the shisha bar stays open until 12 AM.\r\nPardis in Upper Kololo specializes in Middle Eastern cuisine which is Persian and Arabian food', 'timthumb.php_6850938303.jpg', 0, 77, 0),
